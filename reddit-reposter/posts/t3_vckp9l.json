Until last week he was generally a \"work hard/bootstraps\" kinda guy, but after just 6 shifts full of backbreaking labor and passive aggressive management for minimum wage, he's come to understand just how bad low-wage workers have it and is rightly pissed off.\n\nIt's disappointing that he had to experience it personally before believing it, but... one more boomer on the team!\n\nEdited edit: Because a lot of people are assuming my dad is a conservative: He's not. He's a fairly liberal man and ran a construction business and then later a restaurant. He knows what hard work is, but is just now learning there is no longer any value to it.\n\n(removed parts of edit that were distracting from the main point of all of this).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/vckp9l/my_boomer_dad_realized_today_why_nobody_wants_to/", "is_nsfw": false}
