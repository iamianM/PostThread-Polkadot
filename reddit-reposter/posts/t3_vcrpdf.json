Much more than they can train to replace, resulting in significant loss of profits, so our company is desperately trying to plug the leaks by tracking down which companies are hiring us and begging them to stop. And it\u2019s working. We\u2019re being black listed from these opportunities where we\u2019d be earning 2x and 3x more at these better jobs just so my company can protect their profits. Not to get into specifics but in my industry you can NOT just quit first then seek employment elsewhere. It\u2019s basically a requirement that you are currently employed to seek and earn new employment.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/vcrpdf/the_ceo_of_my_company_has_told_other_companies/", "is_nsfw": false}
