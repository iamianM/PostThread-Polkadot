Thanks to all for sharing their stories and advice for how to not only cope with this feeling, but use it as motivation to work harder to prove that I am a valuable member of my team. The reaction to this post has helped me realize that dwelling in my own negativity is not going to get me anywhere. It was nice to hear from people in similar situations with similar frustrations and know that I\u2019m not alone, but now I\u2019m going to try to use this as a learning opportunity and move on with a better understanding of where I\u2019m trying to get to in the future.\n\nFuck I am being severely underpaid and it\u2019s making it extremely hard to give a shit about this team anymore. My team is only made up of 12 people, but the gap between me and the next lowest paid person is nearly $30k. Between me and the highest paid is $130k. I understand that we\u2019re all in different positions and levels of seniority, but still\u2026 I\u2019ve lost all motivation to work hard and deliver for my team when I\u2019m not being compensated for the level of stress I\u2019m taking on doing the grunt work of people making 4x my salary.
