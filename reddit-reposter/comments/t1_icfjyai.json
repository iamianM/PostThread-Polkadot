He was trying real hard but you can\u2019t out-effort sleep deprivation. It just catches up with you. \n\nAlways felt real bad for him. Every time I\u2019d ask how his weekend went it was always some mega huge family ordeal that sounded like a total nightmare. The man just needed time to himself and he never got it. It\u2019s been years since I left that job but I wonder how he\u2019s doing."}
