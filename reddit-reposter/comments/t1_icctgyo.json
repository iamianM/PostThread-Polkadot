To be clear, this makes sense to me, even if it isn't intuitive, as others have stated. The correlation between race and forced poverty, and between poverty and pollution/climate change fallout are pretty well documented; the conflation of, \"Non-white communities suffer more from pollution,\" is just an unusual framing of this issue. Lots of intersecting issues of oppression are like that."}
