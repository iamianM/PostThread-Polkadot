You can love someone and not be able to meet their needs. They can love you and not have fair or appropriate views on needs vs wants or just have needs that are incompatible with yours. You still love that person, even under those conditions, you just aren't compatible. \n\nLove often acts as solid reasoning for sacrifice but sacrifice isn't necessary for love. Stop testing everyone's boundaries. Instead, be honest about your own, challenge the idea of how much of yourself you have to give, and make the authentic choice to accept someone with their boundaries or don't. \n\nI guess what I'm really getting at is that just because you sacrifice in the name of love doesn't necessarily justify your love or it's depth. And not being able to sacrifice doesn't mean you don't love someone. A dog that isn't fed will eventually become aggressive. It doesn't mean the dog doesn't love you, only that it's needs aren't being met. Stop demanding sacrifice and start ensuring needs are being met."}
