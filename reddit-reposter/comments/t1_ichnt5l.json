YES\n\nWill we get this? NO WAY IN HELL.  There will be *a flood* of money thrown against this the likes of which Washington has never seen.  Senators will be guaranteed that their children's children's children's tuition is paid if full as long as this type of ban never sees the light of day. Companies as diverse as Google and McDonald's and Charles Schwab and Pelaton and Joe's Fried Shrimp Shack will come together in harmonious union to kill this type of legislation dead. \n\nMark my words."}
