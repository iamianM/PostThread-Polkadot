Remember everyone, *this is not a law yet*. The bill still needs to be passed by the House of Representatives, too. Please, if you're in America [call /email / fax your representative](http://ziplook.house.gov/htbin/findrep?ZIP=11377&Submit=FIND+YOUR+REP+BY+ZIP) and tell him / her you oppose SJ Resolution 34. 

We managed to stop SOPA and PIPA -- we can stop this monstrosity, too!
