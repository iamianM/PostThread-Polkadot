Religious people see their beliefs as the highest law, above the government, above everything. Whether you believe or not, it's something that you, from their perspective, have to obey. For them, it'd be like breaking the law, doing burglary or murder, and expecting no consequences because you don't believe the government. Like, no, the law doesn't CARE what you believe, only that you don't break it. These are \"THE RULES\".\n\nAnd, to be clear, I'm an atheist, I fundamentally agree with the point being made, I just think the argument being used to make it is dumb. It's preaching to the choir, anyone willing to listen to it sees religious rules as being exclusive to those within the religion, but the religion and its followers see those rules as applying to everyone."}
