If someone is setting up a device to spy on you, I\u2019d assume they\u2019re savvy enough to take the very simple steps to cover their tracks. I\u2019d be more worried about what this app is going to in the event that I don\u2019t delete it. Being connected to wifi or the internet in general also aren\u2019t requirements for recording devices. \n\nIf you think you\u2019re better off in a hotel than an Airbnb then you\u2019re delusional. Hotel staff have been installing spy cams for generations."}
