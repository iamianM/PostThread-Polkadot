Bans on abortion violates several rights such as the 4th Ammendment, a person's right to security in their persons, the 14th Ammendment which grants US citizenship upon birth and Naturalization, not before. And under organ donation laws, organs are legally considered possessions of the person. So extrapolating from there, an unborn human is an organ of the person pregnant with them, meaning that the pregnant person can dictate which of their organs they want to modify and which ones they can keep in their in their body. The only person that can give an unborn human the right to life is the person pregnant with it. Forcing someone to give birth is equal to harvesting their organs without consent."}
