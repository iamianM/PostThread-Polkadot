In the application process prior to being selected for the contestant pool, a prospective contestant has to write down five factoids for anecdotes; on the day of taping (a week\u2019s worth of episodes is taped a day), a contestant starts off by writing two factoids on another form they fill out that day, and the host will choose one to talk about without telling the contestant which one was chosen, so things can be a little more spontaneous.  I presume that if a contestant stays on as champion for a while they get to come up with more anecdote fodder."}
