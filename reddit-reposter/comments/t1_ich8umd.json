But yeah this happens Ex: the other day I was going through Costco in my wheelchair and a kid did stare but it was followed by a \u201cWhoah that\u2019s so cool\u201d!! And then the parent said \u201cshhh no, step back.\n\nAlso, Cocomelon doesn\u2019t have anything on Elmo, daughter prefers Elmo and walks when Cocomelon is on."}
