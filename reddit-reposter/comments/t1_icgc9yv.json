I\u2019m surprised they haven\u2019t attempted to deflect by saying that this was actually Omar or Tlaib praying for Allah to strike down Kavanaugh. \n\nNo group does more to discredit Christianity in the eyes of the world than the Christian Right. They make Jesus at best look and sound like a fucking chump and at worst a psychopath. Which is a shame, because he had some good ideas. This is why taking the Lord\u2019s name in vain is a sin. It\u2019s not about saying \u201cGoddamnit\u201d when the Packers humiliate the Bears for the 80th goddamn time in a row. It\u2019s about inserting your own moronic worldviews into the mouth of God and making everyone think your God is a fucking moron."}
