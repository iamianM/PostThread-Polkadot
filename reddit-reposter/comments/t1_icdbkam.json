They believe they\u2019re as constant and true as the laws of physics. So, they believe it is their obligation to impose their rules on others because it is \u201cmorally illegal\u201d, so to speak, to not follow these rules. Christianity, for example, must be imposed on others by nature. It\u2019s fucked up."}
