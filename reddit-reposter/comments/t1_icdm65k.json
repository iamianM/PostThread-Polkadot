It is so frustrating having to fight this hard for the bare minimum. \n\n$15 minimum wage is outdated by this point but it's a start. \n\nMedicare for all is a start but we are so behind in the times it's crazy... \n\nThis isn't even getting into the housing crisis, accessibility issues for disabled people, and so many other things that need work. And asking for a government that works for us is seen as extremist."}
