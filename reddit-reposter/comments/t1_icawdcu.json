Like what makes nipples offensive? And why are boobs less offensive than vaginas? And why is an upward dick more offensive than a downward dick?\n\nEdit: a lot of people seem confused about the upward/downward dick thing. My point was that the ratings people see a flaccid dick as less offensive than an erect one. Which is kind of bizarre."}
