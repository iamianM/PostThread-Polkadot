A 27 year old MAN who doesn't contribute to the household, AND got arrested, deserves to be kicked out. If you have money for tactical gear, travel and a hotel room, then you should be paying your own rent. \n\nStop infanticizing this doofus, hes a grown man who needs to face the consequences of his actions, not a 17 year old who was vulnerable and manipulated."}
