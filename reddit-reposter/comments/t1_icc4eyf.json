There is no human understandable objective reason to this life, only what we make of this. We will all come and go. Death is certain, just the time and way it will occur elude us.\n\nThere is an incredible sadness in this realization, but this is just the surface of a much deeper feeling. A feeling of unconditional love and compassion to all living beings.\n\nI think giving a little kind attention to those around us, something we may sometimes forget to do while overcoming hurdles of daily life, has a quality of very ordinary magic.\n\nI'm mourning one of my familiars who passed this weekend and I get heady at times."}
