He knew, he knew we knew, we got drunk and had a long conversation about it. His daughter grew up to be one of the sweetest, most beautiful people. I now enjoy hanging out with her and her husband more than her dad.. I found out later that my son %100 believed she got more Native American blood than her suuuuper white brother. He was fucking flabbergasted to find out she was half black.. lmfao"}
