It wasn\u2019t until I was in my 30\u2019s that it all clicked. Chores are something that need to be done regardless, if I\u2019m not doing it, someone else will have to, or we will all be living in filth. Since I reframed chores as, \u201cI do this because I am worthy of living in a clean home\u201d, chores have actually become almost fun. Sure, chores can teach kids a lot, but it also has to be taught to them why we do chores."}
