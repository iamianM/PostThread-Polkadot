It\u2019s much better pay, it\u2019s work that I enjoy doing, the people seem great and there\u2019s all these other things that are good about the job, but for some reason all I can think about is failing, so I remind myself how lucky I am, and that there\u2019s a better chance that I won\u2019t fail. It\u2019s a bitter demon to fight, but not impossible."}
