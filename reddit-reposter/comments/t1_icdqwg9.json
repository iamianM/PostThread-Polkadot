Everything you said made sense to me, but one. I suppose the mailing company had to apply paper address labels, right? Did you know you could get mailing labels with the fiche printed on them, right next to the address? This would have made it a lot simpler. I can only guess the labels were already printed, and  there was no way to reprint them.\n\nLater, we would have used an ink-jet printer and it would have been a piece of cake, but I don't think they existed in the 1980s.\n\nAnyway, it's a pleasure to hear from someone who knows something about the bulk mailing business. It's such an esoteric field, I have never seen it mentioned at Reddit before."}
