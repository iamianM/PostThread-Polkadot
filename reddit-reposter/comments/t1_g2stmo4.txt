Reminds me of a party me and my class threw for our favourite English teachers birthday a few years ago, we went and bought cake, party poppers and a birthday card that we all wrote out names on wishing him a happy birthday.

About 30 min before the class started we asked another teacher to unlock the classroom and we set up in there, 5 minutes before class started he unlocked the door and we all yelled happy birthday!

He was really happy and instead of doing the actual things he had planned we all ate our cake and played different party games together, it was our last year at that school so we wanted to make it a bit special for him.

Still my best memory from that school.
