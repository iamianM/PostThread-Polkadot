Demand for the product fell off at a Fortune 500 company so they brought in consultants and sent out \u2018please tell us what you do all day\u2019 surveys.  My task was to work with the consultant group to get a data viz up on our server to make it easier to leadership to look at everything, but while I was doing that they asked me to help out with some changes/updates to the viz (Tableau for my BI crew). \n\nIn order to do so I had to break the whole thing open and there it all was in an attached Excel book. Not only was it everyone\u2019s salary, level, and bonuses for the entire division (couple of thousand people), it had their PII, and the results from the surveys that had bucketized everyone into 3 categories from highly valuable to expendable.  Of course I checked my status before doing any more work.  They proceeded to use this data to lay off about 1/3 of my division. I left shortly after making the cut."}
