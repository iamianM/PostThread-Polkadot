I told them \u2018It\u2019s not difficult - all you have to do is be the best.\u2019 \n\nWhich sounds really naive, but to this day, that\u2019s the attitude I keep. I might not be world-renowned or anything, but I strive to be one of the best at what I do that my friends and co-workers know, at least, and it really is working. \u263a\ufe0f It really helps to root me in knowing what I do and don\u2019t need to be \u2018the best\u2019 at, and is a major confidence boost when I am the best, and a motivator to learn and grow when I\u2019m not."}
