Her call was cut off when the North Tower came into view.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeline_Amy_Sweeney\n\n\"My wife's call was the first specific information the airline and the government got that day,\" said Mike Sweeney, the widowed husband of Amy Sweeney, who went face to face with the hijackers on Flight 11. She gave seat locations and physical descriptions of the hijackers, which allowed officials to identify them as Middle Eastern men-by name-even before the first crash. She gave officials key clues to the fact that this was not a traditional hijacking. And she gave the first and only eyewitness account of a bomb on board.\n\n\"How do you know it's a bomb?\" asked her phone contact.\n\n\"Because the hijackers showed me a bomb,\" Sweeney said, describing its yellow and red wires.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20071207153421/http://www.observer.com/node/48805"}
