I had the opportunity to meet him when I was a Soldier. He was at Camp Doha in Kuwait for the 4th of July when he was running for governor. I took a picture with him and was on a plane to Iraq hours later. Very friendly guy.


Edit: Oh crap! Sorry Gov. Very cute puppers! I highjacked the thread by reminiscing.
