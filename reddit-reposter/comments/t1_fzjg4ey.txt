Thanks, governator. 

Mini Arnold story.

When he was campaigning in California he stopped at my town, Tracy, to speak at the mall there. My family was there for an unrelated reason (buying video games..I think Kingdom Hearts 1) and we stopped to watch him speak, but we couldn't get in front with the proper crowd. So we watched him speak from behind However, he had all the television lights in front of him, so all I could see was this giant glowing golden god. And then he became our governor. I was like, 11? It was pretty majestic.
