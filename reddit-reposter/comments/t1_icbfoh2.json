It's the stupid headline using the term IQ.  The study doesn't.  What it does say is that there was a decline in the cognitive development of children born during the pandemic.  They use something called the Mullen Scales of Early Learning.\n\n>A new study by researchers at five universities found that babies born during the pandemic may have lower IQ scores than those born before it. Babies who came into the world before the coronavirus had a cognitive score hovering around 100, according to this study. But the test scores of babies born during the pandemic fell sharply, to around 78. That\u2019s 22 points lower than what\u2019s considered normal.\n\n>Children were assessed on key metrics, such as fine and gross motor control, visual reception and language. Babies were evaluated on developmentally appropriate benchmarks, like babbling, crawling and rolling over.\n\n[source](https://edsource.org/2021/pandemic-may-have-lowered-baby-iq-study-says/661285#:~:text=A%20new%20study%20by%20researchers,100%2C%20according%20to%20this%20study.)"}
