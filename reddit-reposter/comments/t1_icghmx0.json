The IRS can\u2019t accept a single check (including a cashier\u2019s check) for amounts of $100,000,000 ($100 million) or more. If you are sending $100 million or more by check, you\u2019ll need to spread the payment over 2 or more checks with each check made out for an amount less than $100 million.*\n\n*This limit doesn\u2019t apply to other methods of payment (such as electronic payments). Please consider a method of payment other than check if the amount of the payment is over $100 million.*"}
