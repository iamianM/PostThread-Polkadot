The two got along really well on TV and those interviews always felt like watching two friends talking. Ken is pretty good at engaging the contestants as well and never seems to feign interest in the stories they choose to share. Beyond that, he\u2019s a solid host and clearly enjoys doing it. I really hope that the executives stop twiddling their thumbs and just hire him full time instead of having him split time."}
