Consistent in his views but open to change, yet not stubborn and willing to listen to new viewpoints.\n\nPeople really just can\u2019t believe he cares about them. Because you then have to realize how much basically everyone else, most democrats and every single member of the GOP, despise their constituents and actively make the lives of you and your family worse just to hold onto power."}
