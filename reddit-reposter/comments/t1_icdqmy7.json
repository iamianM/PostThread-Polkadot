Hidden and secret swimming hole. Anyway, I hit the water from like 50 feet up, and *blamo!* go like 10 feet deep and get a trout up my fucking shorts. Here I am 10 feet under with a damn trout squirming around my balls. 0/10. Awful experience. Almost lost my breath trying to simultaneously get a damn fish out of my junk, and come up for air."}
