Also kinda suspect its fake because I don't think in *college* you would get sent to a counselor for a crappy presentation, though ig it's possible. \n\nBut unless it's a plagiarized speech there's no academic dishonesty and depending on how the grade rubric works, Anon isn't even necessarily gonna flunk the class. On top of that it's a required course for basically everyone so unless communications is his major he's probably never gonna see any of the people in the class again. \n\nSo he's doomed to severe awkwardness for the rest of the semester but that's about it."}
