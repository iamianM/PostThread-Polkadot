Your presentation, if it was real was original and not plagiarized. If everyone got 5 minutes for their presentation you used time that was allotted to you. \nHowever, the worst thing that could happen in this scenario is everyone in your class thinks you are a weirdo and you remember the awkwardness/ embarrassment every once in a while for the foreseeable future and this presentation will be how people remember you after you are done college, if they remember you at all."}
