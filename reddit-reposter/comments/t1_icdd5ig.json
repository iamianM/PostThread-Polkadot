To be able to shrug off outside distractions and do their job that without context may look and sound silly.\n\nTake a look at any of the preproduction footage of modern movies.  Looks silly to see a man seriously scared of a tennis ball on a stick that tuens out to be a raptor in Jurassic Park. Or Avengers prepping for battle getting pumped up against nothing, that turn out to be Thanos and swarms of Ultron bots."}
