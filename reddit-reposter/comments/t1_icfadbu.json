I forget which it was specifically, but somehow we got onto the topic of classic myths and legends that have inspired the names of planets and so on\n\nso i told the anecdote of the legend of cyclopes, particularly Polyphemus, and how they were said to eat people and such. told them about the elephant skulls and how they inspired the myths, and that it was a cool bit of history\n\nthought it was a nice story to tell before we went home, as a way to wrap up the day. the kids thought it was cool, and were joking about \"bringing some humans for lunch\" the next day\n\ni did NOT expect to get called into the camp director's office the next morning and have to explain why i told \"a scary story that gave one of your campers nightmares and made this morning hell for his grandparents\". \n\nturns out that one of the 12 year olds was a bit more sensitive than i had thought, and Polyphemus was such a chad that he haunted the little dude's dreams alllll night. I apologized to the grandparents, explained the lesson that we'd had, they laughed, the kid was slightly embarrassed and i didn't tell stories about giant one eyed men eating sailors in class anymore"}
