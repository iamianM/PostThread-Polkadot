The Grand Inquisitor had a hostile relationship with Vader and tried to dig dirt on him to become Palpatine's new apprentice.  After visiting Polis Massa and confirming on Naboo that Padme's pregnancy at her funeral was faked and she had given birth, the Grand Inquisitor was going to report to Palpatine in a bid to unseat Vader, but Olin kills him.  By that point, Obi-Wan had learned of Vader's survival and avoids direct confrontation with him, while Olin unfortunately encounters him a number of times and learns on his own who he actually is.  \n\nIn the end, Olin is persuaded by Obi-Wan to watch over Leia like how Obi-Wan would for Luke.  Vader eventually finds him and kills him shortly after ANH, when Luke and Leia no longer needed to be watched over, but never learned about Obi-Wan until ANH."}
