They are both about a child that is thrown into the world. They are both created by a father who then expects them to figure out what\u2019s good, what\u2019s bad, the ethics, the morals, love, life, and essentials, on their own. I think that was, for me, childhood. You had to figure it out with your very limited experience.\u201d\n\nCast:\n\n* Gregory Mann as Pinocchio\n* Ewan McGregor as Sebastian J.
