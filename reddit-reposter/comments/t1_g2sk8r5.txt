When my highschool calculus teacher heard I was not doing great in university level calculus,  he offered to have me come into the school on his day off and tutored me for free to get my grades up.

Later on that year his father died and shortly after he found out his wife was having an affair with the vice principal.  He ended up shooting himself and I was heartbroken.  I still remember the last time I saw him and he asked how my calc was - I was still flunking it but since he had made such an effort I lied and said my grades had turned around.
