Went to Insbruck hospital after as I did my back in.\n\nThings you missed in the video.\n\n1) Your not allowed to stop on the slope for any reason\n\n2) The father thought it was a good idea to stop on the slope 4 times\n\n3) I had a massive queue of people behind me because of the plebs in front.\n\n4) I had waited a year to do this slope, gave them plenty of time to get some distance, they where clearly waiting to annoy me.\n\n5) It was a rage quit where the only way was down !!\n\nHe was clearly using his kids as bate, they where collateral in his little \ngames. On the way to the start we all shared the same gondola, I \nexplained to him I had been waiting almost a year to do the slope. You \ncan see him laughing as he gets the kid out of the coaster at the end.\n\nWhat happened I believe is Alpine coasters space the riders far apart so \nit's very difficult to hit anyone..  The parents deliberately stopped on\n the ride several times so that their family could catch up to each \nother and go down the ride slowly while talking.  This is completely \ndangerous and against the rules.  That's not how an alpine coaster works\n and you're not supposed to ride together as a family.  It's dangerous \nto do that. \u201c\n\nThis comment was pulled off the original YouTube video"}
