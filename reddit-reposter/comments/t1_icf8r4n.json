I just chuckled and told him go for it. Then we talked about it more and we worried \u201eWait, carrots get eaten!\u201c. His solution? \u201eThen I don\u2019t wanna be a carrot, I wanna be an apple!\u201c  \n\nIn the end he realized that apples get eaten too and now he just wants to be himself when he grows up. \n\nBut he doesn\u2019t wanna grow as tall as Papa, that\u2019s very important!
