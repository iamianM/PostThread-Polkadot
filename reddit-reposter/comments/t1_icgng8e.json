They ended in 1997 when Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese control, and therefore the texts claim Hong Kong was never a British colony.\n\nThis was the same argument that the British tried to use to avoid returning HK to China, that they hadn't signed the treaty with the PRC and therefore had no legal obligation to return the territory they colonized.  It's not a straight up denial that the territory was controlled by the British, it's a specific claim about the legitimacy of colonization ( namely that they don't believe that it was ever legitimate for HK to be colonized).   \n\n\nThe title is sensationalistic, but since most people won't scroll beyond the title and read the article most people will be left with an inaccurate impression. I hate this mode of journalism."}
