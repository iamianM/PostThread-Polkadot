You can let anyone who reaches out with interest about your resume that information needs to stay confidential because you heard about a Recruiter reaching out to your friend's current employer for a reference *without their permission* so you're going to make damn sure that doesn't happen to you- it almost cost your friend their job.\n\nOnly once you have a written offer will you share your current employer, and professional references.\n\nEarlier this year/late last year Thedacare (a hospital) tried to get a restraining order to prevent Ascension from taking some of their nurses and technicians.  The restraining order was dropped by a judge, and Thedacare withdrew their lawsuit... but it was a process, and not everyone has the financial resources to seek legal remedy.  So there is some truth to other people's feedback that what your employer is doing is against the law- *unless* your company has/had a business relationship with the companies you're considering.  I have some clients that won't hire from their customers, or suppliers they have a close relationship with unless they get a release.\n\nNot everyone wants to go to court, report their employer to the department of labor, or go through a legal process.  Confidential Company will likely help you skip that if you wish, and if the company you're hoping to join withdraws their offer because you're at a company they \"can't\" hire from... well then your current employer just cost you money, and you can seek damages in Civil Court depending on what information you have- and if you can confirm there is no business relationship between the two companies."}
