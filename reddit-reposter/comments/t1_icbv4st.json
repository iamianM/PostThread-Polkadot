They had a special class called \"\u041e\u0411\u0416\" Which is an acronym that roughly translates to \"basics of safety and life management\".they taught us useful stuff like CPR and other various medical emergencies but along with that they taught  some weird stuff like assembling AK-47, putting on a gas mask ,and what to do Incase a nuclear attack .The class was lead by an ex military guy and he spent like half the class time spewing Russian propaganda. It was an... Interesting experience.\n\nedit: grammer(I'm an American citizen just with Russian parents so i have no excuse to be this shit at English)"}
