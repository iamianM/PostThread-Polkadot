Got the exact same goalpost moving and lashing out that this crazy bitch did in the article.  These people don't wanna be right, they wanna be terrible people.  \n\nMeanwhile the Sandy Hook dad is keeping up the fight, but it's mostly filing takedown claims when these nutters use pictures of his kid for memes or stories.  Poor dude has moved about 10 times due to stalking and harassing, and changed his number more times than he can remember, these Sandy Hook nutters are not healthy, rational, or any way nice people.  Like the daughter said in the article, it becomes their life.\n\nEdit: link to the episode https://www.thisamericanlife.org/670/beware-the-jabberwock"}
