She is the one that fucked up. Don't take her mistakes on as your own. She's a cheater, she would've found someone else eventually. The real fuck up is not finding out earlier in the relationship\n\nSorry this happened to you, though. Try not to let it ruin future relationships, and get yourself someone who'll treat you right."}
