A lot of people only call their SO by the first name when it\u2019s serious. My family and a lot of others do it. In my family it\u2019s literally just to quickly alert someone like \u201chey we need to talk\u201d \u201chey something important happened\u201d I see why it could be seen as \u201ctoxic\u201d with his reaction but it\u2019s clear it\u2019s just not normal for her to first name him which to me implies they only first name each other in serious situations. It\u2019s actually a rather passive way of alerting to the severity of things. It just depends on the circumstances like most other things."}
