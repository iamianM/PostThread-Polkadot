It is only a matter of time until the every day retail investor gets a win. \n\nThis win will be a big one. One that changes the course of humanity for the better. \n\nWe are at a turning point, and I really think the movement to DRS all of GameStop available float is just starting to ramp up. \n\nEven if you are unaware of the movement, or what is going on in the markets, or don't even know what a candle on a chart is. Think of it as a lottery ticket that doesn't expire and is a guaranteed win as long as you don't lose your ticket. WHY WOULDN'T YOU JOIN IN ON THE FIGHT? It's easy and there are step by step instructions everywhere.\n\nThank you to all of you for doing your part in making a difference and thank you to those that created [https://www.drsgme.org/](https://www.drsgme.org/) \n\nHistory is currently being made, and you are all a part of it.\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\udd12\ud83c\udd99\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80"}
