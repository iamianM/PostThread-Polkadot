President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the war may stagnate if deliveries of advanced weapons from Ukraine\u2019s allies don\u2019t accelerate. \n> \n> NATO ministers are meeting in Brussels with the nearly four-month-old war at the top of their agenda. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin opened a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on Wednesday pledging to maintain military support for Ukraine as the country faces a \u201cpivotal moment\u201d on the battlefield.\n> \n> \u201cWe can\u2019t underestimate the challenge that Ukraine faces,\u201d Austin said at NATO headquarters in Brussels. \u201cRussia is using its long-range fires to try to overwhelm Ukrainian positions.\u201d\n> \n> The US has steadily ratcheted up support for Ukraine while batting away questions about how long the flow of aid will last and whether it would support any deal that included Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.\n> \n> Meanwhile, the fallout from the conflict is driving sharp increases in the price of gasoline and food, a bitter political headwind for Biden heading into midterm elections this fall. \n> \n> \u201cWhen we decided we were going to help Ukraine -- the point that I was making was that it\u2019s going to cost us too,\u201d Biden said at a June 10 fundraiser."}
