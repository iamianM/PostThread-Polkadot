They often venture quite a long distance for food, as they mainly eat fruits, seeds and carrion. Their burrows are up to five feet deep and the only reason for them to be at the beach is to lay eggs, which is mostly done at night, then back to the burrows they go. Their meat is delicious, richer than blue crab and a bit darker in color."}
