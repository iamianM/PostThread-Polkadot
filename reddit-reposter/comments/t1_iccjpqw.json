And he is on a visa with 90 days left to find a job.\n\nHe tagged them in the post and they have gotten a lot of hate.\n\nDon\u2019t work for a crytpo company.\n\nEDIT: someone just sent me a DM saying they work for Coinbase and the post on LinkedIn is fake. To that person: I know Reddit is anonymous, but you\u2019re breaking Social Media protocol if you\u2019re not operating in an official capacity. So I\u2019m going to disagree unless an official from Coinbase proves otherwise."}
