Lake Tahoe.  4 lane undivided road. 45mph.  I\u2019m sitting in center waiting to turn left.  I\u2019d been there awhile, Friday afternoon.   This guy in a white Mercedes stops on his side and motions me to turn.  Sure would have been nice if he had let the people in the right lane beside him know that I was going to just blindly turn in front of them while they\u2019re doing 45-50mph.   Have you seen the people with their own understanding of Right of Way?  They figure all they got to do is come to a complete stop at a 4 way and then if someone is on their left then they can just go because they have the Right of Way."}
