Not a boomer but always worked office jobs working up to a quite senior position then I got made redundant and for other reasons I decided to just get a minimum wage job. I could not believe how you're treated. Expected to work when they say whether you have plans or not. Be cover whenever they want. You get a 16 hour contract so can't plan anything. Hounded the full shift even if you just get on with it. Time keeping and breaks are monitored like they're the stasi, toilet breaks are frowned upon if you take more than a couple of minutes. Management that really don't care and will run you into the ground. My other jobs were fully flexible, as long as the work was done they didn't care. Want to finish early? No problem sometimes without even having to make it back up. Doctors appointment? Just start late and make it up no point using a holiday for that. Nice lunch room with everything you need. Some places even had canteens. Onsite gym that's free but that's not all of them. Life insurance. Matched pension contributions. Loans for bikes or your public transport yearly ticket."}
