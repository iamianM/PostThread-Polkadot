I once had a lamp that turned itself on and off, pull cord too. Dad opened it up, sure enough faulty wiring. \n\nAlso, roommate implies rent, which implies a landlord. Make sure you don\u2019t have a nosy landlord who forgot to clean up after they snooped (they could have been checking for things left behind by your roommate, or a neighbor could\u2019ve broken in for the same reason). \n\nWhich brings me to my next point, the homes of the recently deceased are often robbed.
