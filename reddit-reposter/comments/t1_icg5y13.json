Walker is so patently unfit it seems like his entire candidacy is parody. But we know the routine by now:\n\nHerschel Walker beats women and the response is, \u201cit\u2019s a smear campaign of incident(s) twisted out of context without the whole story and he has changed\u201d;\n\nHerschel Walker has a history of violent/erratic behavior and the answer is \u201cwhy do liberals now suddenly use bipolar disorder against this God fearing man?\u201d\n\nWalker hasn\u2019t seen a son in years after decrying absentee fathers and the defense is \u201cwho better understands this than a man who can\u2019t see his son due to his mother?\u201d\n\nWhenever you think you\u2019ve run into an issue that\u2019d draw a mea culpa and contrition from the trump mind, just get creative put that thang down flip it & reverse it."}
