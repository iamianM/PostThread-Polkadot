If I remember correctly they were shooting a short movie and the result was actually quite good and hugely different by what you could surmise by being a bystander and not knowing what actually they were doing.\n\nKind of like the shot someone got from their apartment of Joaquin Phoenix dancing down the stairs as the joker.
