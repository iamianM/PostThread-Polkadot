Too late guys... I bought perpetual licenses of the whole Affinity suite of products for 75 bucks. The learning curve isn't too bad, neither.\n\nEDIT: Lots of repeat questions that I'd like to sort... I got the software on sale. It's still MUCH cheaper than Adobe, but not currently as cheap as I got it. I don't know if it encompasses Lightroom, but they handle InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator. Any detailed questions should be taken over to r/Affinity. I'm a filthy casual. :)"}
