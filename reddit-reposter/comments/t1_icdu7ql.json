The farmer refused. The men returned a few days later and told the farmer he was the only white man in Plains who hadn\u2019t signed up. That didn\u2019t change his mind. The men returned a third time with some of the farmer\u2019s customers, who threatened to boycott his business. If he couldn\u2019t afford the $5 dues, they would lend it to him. \u201cI\u2019ve got $5,\u201d the farmer responded. \u201cAnd I\u2019d flush it down the toilet before I\u2019d give it to you.\u201d\n\nThe farmer, in case you haven\u2019t guessed, was Jimmy Carter.\u201d"}
