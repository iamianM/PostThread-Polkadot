Parvo no joke. Will never forget that smell of blood and poop and death that comes from them. Worst was we had about 5-6 puppies in a run once. One was a jerk and had to be removed. The others got parvo and we had to euthanize. The butthole still got parvo but not as bad and survived. Being an asshole saved his life."}
