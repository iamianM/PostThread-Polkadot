Lady coming out of a shopping plaza had a stop sign and I guess the right lane SUV gave her the wave of death. Due to that SUV being so far up and my A-pillar I didn't even see her SUV until she basically hit me. The dashcam is wide angle and about 10 inches forward of where I sit so it saw the car way before I did. Right after she hit me she gets out and is like \"I had a stop sign!!!\" Cops came and took our statements and had the report ready the next day where they said I had right of way. \n\nThankfully no injuries in either car since it was fairly low speed. I was only doing ~20mph and she was trying to pull out of the lot.\n\nI was just finally able to get the car into the shop and it's fixable but will take a month or longer. Luckily insurance gave me a rental for the duration which they are billed for. Insurance also found me 0% liable. \n\nThis was the damage afterwards: \n\nmy car: https://i.imgur.com/97R4Epk.jpg \n\nher car: https://i.imgur.com/WIhZlE1.jpg\n\n\n*** edit: since there was confusion the road in total is 4 lanes with 2 lanes going east (direction I was traveling) and 2 lanes going west (where she was trying to turn). The side I was on has a left lane that is straight only and the right lane is turn right or straight and merge left."}
