I took a photography class in college and I remember going out to the railroad tracks and taking a picture I was pretty proud of. Now I am a science guy with absolutely no art ability, but I figured photography has physics in it and I always wanted to give it a try. When we had our class critique my professor gave me no information about my photo other than everyone takes pictures of the railroad tracts and I should be more original. Well I wish your dad had taken his class and shown that pompous asshole this picture because it is fucking awesome! Also I failed his class, so fuck that that.
