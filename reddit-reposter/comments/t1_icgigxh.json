We came up with a skit about trying to come up with a skit. We threw it together the afternoon before, and we thought it was pretty funny. \n\nOn stage, we awkwardly began the short skit. After less than 30 seconds we were asked to leave as it was apparent we didn't prepare anything. Meta humor is tough."}
