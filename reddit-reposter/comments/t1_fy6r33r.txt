Imagine being taken from your home against your will by the government that serves you. Now, imagine being handcuffed, blindfolded, and loaded into a vehicle you can't describe due to being blindfolded. Now, after being driven wherever, they take you out of the vehicle and just make you sit somewhere. No information given.


I know I cannot imagine that. My heart and compassion go out to every Uighur.
