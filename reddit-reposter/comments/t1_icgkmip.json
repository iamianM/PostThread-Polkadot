This is a good thing. \n\nLove may even be defined ecologically as \u201cThe universal property that emerges in relationship when both/all parties hold the well-being of self and other in equal and high regard, acting in alignment with this regard\u201d\n\nThis type of transactional, mutually beneficial love is a major driving force in our societies and ecosystems.
