He was very polite and sorted it out. He asked me why and I told him that the kid had been bullying me for ages and I got sick of it and snapped. He told me that I should have at least have dressed up to hit the bloke as it would have shown him that it was a point of respect, not just the arm swinging bollocks of a common thug. He told me that if somebody knows you are dressed smartly to kick their arse, they know they must deserve it, because who wants blood on their best clothes."}
