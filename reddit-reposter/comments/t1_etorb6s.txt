Haha... That was exactly it when my brother tried to get me into WoW.   

Him, " I can run you through raids to get you to level up faster and get better gear.  But first you need to be this min level.  What are you"

Me "lvl 1". 

Him "ok. Let's do a couple quests to get you up.  What is your quest" 

Me "collect 20 apples".
