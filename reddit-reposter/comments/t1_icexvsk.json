She was literally the best woman I've ever loved and I threw it all away right as I realized she would've stayed if I just took one step to helping myself. \n\nI'm not trying to bum anyone out. I'm just saying if you find that unicorn woman, whether she's the exact version like this post or whatever your version of perfect is, cherish her. No woman is gonna treat you like a king if you don't first treat her like a queen."}
