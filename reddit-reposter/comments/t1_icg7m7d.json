It\u2019s a long held and established belief that the mothers life is supreme and the baby does not exist until it\u2019s born.\n\nETA: there are understandably various interpretations of Judaism. I am by no means an expert on the faith I do not practice. This is just the view of one Jewish person. She/I do not speak for all Jewish people."}
