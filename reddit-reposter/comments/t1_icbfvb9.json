People even gave a name to the boar.\n\n\nEdit: I did not expect this to explode. So thanks everyone.\n\nJust to make things clear, I will stay quiet regarding the location of the pic. Yes it's somewhere in Europe. But there has been concerns for the boar's safety since he has been roaming freely over the years. I don't know who is looking at this post nor their intention. Thank you for understanding."}
