Did you ever hear the senate of Darth Senate "the senate"? I thought not. It's not a story the Senate would tell you. It's a Senate legend. Darth Senate was a Dark Senate of the Senate, so powerful and so wise he could use the Senate to influence the senate to create senate... He had such a knowledge of the dark senate that he could even keep the senate he cared about from dying. The dark senate of the senate is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his senate, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his senate everything he knew, then his senate killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.
