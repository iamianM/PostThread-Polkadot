A few facts for you all:

* Voter fraud is incredibly rare. The conservative Heritage Foundation [looked for fraud](https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/494649-the-voter-fraud-fraud) over a 36-year period and could only find [1285 cases out of nearly two billion votes cast](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/09/21/voter-fraud-fears-and-mail-worries-grab-headlines-but-the-wait-will-be-the-worry-in-2020/) - a rate of 0.00007%.

* There are election observers in every room where ballots are counted and there are livestreams of most of these counting areas. Yes, this includes Philadelphia, where the Trump Campaign had to [admit in court that they had observers in the room.](https://twitter.com/alanfeuer/status/1324484846857658368)

* Mail-in ballots are legal votes. Those ballots must be cast and post-marked by Election Day. We have been using mail-in ballots since the Civil War, and in 2016, 25% of votes were cast by mail.
