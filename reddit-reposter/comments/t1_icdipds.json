He is speaking to all Americans who consume corporate media whether it's Fox CNN or the Washington Post. He is saying things that are an indictment of not just the Republican party but most of the Democratic party as well. \n\nIf we're not clear about that we won't understand why he was not successful running as a Democrat. It was Democratic Party operatives who smeared and sabotaged his campaign when he was the frontrunner and could have beaten Trump. The Democratic party is no less corporate than the Republican party. The DNC would rather have Trump than Sanders. Never forget that."}
