The baby kept on crying, and I\u2019d hold her on my shoulder walking around until she stopped crying - but then she would like her head up, look at me (and be reminded I wasn\u2019t Mommy,) and she would immediately start crying again. \n\nThis kept up for an hour or two, and I eventually learned to look away when she would look at me,  and she wouldn\u2019t see my face, wouldn\u2019t start crying again, and eventually got to sleep."}
