Why do I care about privacy if I don't have anything to hide?
--------------------------------------------------------------

If you wear clothes, use passwords, close doors, use envelopes, or sometimes speak softly, then you *do* have something to hide; you're just having trouble understanding that *you already do care about privacy*.  Here are some references to help you understand why everyone, *especially honest hard-working people*, needs privacy.

* [TechRepublic - Why 'Nothing to Hide' misrepresents online privacy](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/why-nothing-to-hide-misrepresents-online-privacy/) - A legal research professor explains to Michael P. Kassner why we should think long and hard before subscribing to the "Nothing to Hide" defense of surveillance and data-gathering. 
* [MSNBC - Surveillance: You may have ‘nothing to hide’–but you still have something to fear](http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/08/01/surveillance-you-may-have-nothing-to-hide-but-you-still-have-something-to-fear/) - At first blush, this argument might seem sound—after all, if the government is merely conducting anti-terrorism surveillance, non-terrorists shouldn’t be affected, right? But if you look more closely, you’ll see this idea is full of holes.
* [Wired.com - Why 'I Have Nothing to Hide' Is the Wrong Way to Think About Surveillance](http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/06/why-i-have-nothing-to-hide-is-the-wrong-way-to-think-about-surveillance/) -

Everyone has something to hide, and there will be someone out there who will pay to see what it is.

* [Techdirt - If You've Got Nothing To Hide, You've Actually Got Plenty To Hide](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130613/12180423457/if-youve-got-nothing-to-hide-youve-actually-got-plenty-to-hide.shtml) - The line "if you've got nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry about" is used all too often in defending surveillance overreach. It's been debunked countless times in the past, but with the line being trotted out frequently in response to the NSA revelations, it's time for yet another debunking, and there are two good ones that were recently published.
* [WashingtonExaminer - Even law-abiding people should oppose surveillance](http://washingtonexaminer.com/tim-carney-even-law-abiding-people-should-oppose-surveillance/article/2531452) - In other words, why should law-abiding citizens mind federal surveillance?
* [The Chronicle - Why Privacy Matters Even if You Have 'Nothing to Hide'](https://chronicle.com/article/Why-Privacy-Matters-Even-if/127461/) - A long and thorough article on many, many different reasons why the NTHNTF argument is basically invalid.
* [Mail Online - If we have nothing to hide, then why should we have to prove it?](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2339142/RICHARD-LITTLEJOHN-If-hide-prove-it.html) - Those who have nothing to hide have nothing to fear. Every time the State wants to extend its powers, this trite phrase is wheeled out.

* [The Phoenix - Debunking 'nothing to hide'](http://providence.thephoenix.com/news/154682-debunking-nothing-to-hide/) - 'No secrets' doesn't mean 'no problem'
* [ID Folly: Those with nothing to hide have nothing to fear??](http://www.biometricidentitycards.info/articles/NoHideNoFear.htm) - Everybody else, it is claimed, will be able to enjoy a new sense of security and safety from ideologically inspired violence, fraud and other criminal acts.  The statement that only those with something to hide will have something to fear, is nothing more than a thoughtless and foolish mantra repeated by those who prefer platitudes to the demands of careful and rational thinking.
