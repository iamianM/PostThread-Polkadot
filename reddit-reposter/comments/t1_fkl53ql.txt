It's weird here in Austria. Apparently tomorrow we will not be allowed to go out our houses anymore, except if we need to
1.Buy the things we need to live
2.help people who can't live alone
3.get testet or something idk
and police will be driving around and looking out for people who aren't inside
That's what I was told
