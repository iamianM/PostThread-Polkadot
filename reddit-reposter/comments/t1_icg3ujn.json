One of us would clean surfaces (end tables, counters, etc) and the other would do windows/mirrors. We took turns but they took about the same time. Always knew to expect that on Sunday morning and mom always had the radio or a CD playing. As we got older we also helped outside with dad. I would usually mow and my brother would weed eat, mostly because I couldn't lug around the big gas weed eater on the side of the hill without digging up dirt. \n\nI think the key was, we had equal work that didn't take too long, it was at a regular time every week, and our parents were doing similar tasks at the same time so it felt like a family event. \n\nThis was in addition to the general keeping our rooms tidy."}
