I just don't understand this, at all. People act like the supply chains have shut down and no more TP is being made, you fucking idiots realize there's another semi, on the way, WITH MORE TP, WATER AND RAMEN RIGHT? 

Even in Italy and China where we've seen the worst of this so far, HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED THEY COULDN'T SHIT? NONE. You know how many people have reported they couldn't shit because some asshole bought all the TP? A LOT.

Buy a bidet everybody, it's on Amazon for like $30 and you'll only need like 2 squares of TP for every shit after that, for eternity. If your store is out of lysol wipes, buy the spray bottle and use a cleaning rag. If they run out of bottled water, buy a filter for your tap.

Jesus, everybody who's panicking and doing all of this stuff, just stop. Think about the community at large and how you're impacting it.
