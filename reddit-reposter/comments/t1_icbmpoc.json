Around 2am, the other guard and I were just chilling in camp chair, shooting the shit.  Patrol had dropped off bagged lunches for us, but we ignored em cuz we brought pizza.  I hear one of the lunch bags rustling and look over to see the biggest damn boar I had ever seen nosing through my lunch bag.  \n\nI was terrified.  There other guard just laughed.  \"That's just Rufus,\" he said.  Apparently, when Rufus was a piglet, he had begun a habit of checking with the guards for food.  As the sack lunches they provided were often lacking in flavor, guards would opt for something else and just throw the lunches away.  Well once Rufus started showing up, the guards would just start giving the lunches to him.  \n\nHe was a pretty tame pig.  He loved getting scritches.  If you were sitting in your camp chair, he'd waddle over and shove his head under your arm and demand you love him.  He'd play fetch with a soccer ball we had out there.  But his favorite activity, it seemed, was scaring new people.  \n\nI miss Rufus.  He was a sweet boy.  I wonder how long boars live in the wild."}
