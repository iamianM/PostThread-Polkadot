Anyone and everyone that is calling in with thoughts on what happened is getting airtime. On one channel they had a guy call in SWEARING that it was a missile, that he saw a missile rise out of the water and hit the building. And the news hosts just have nothing to go on because nobody knows shit about what's happening or why.\n\nEven more, on the greenscreen behind the hosts on several channels, you can see the second plane come right in for its impact and nobody in the newsroom noticed for a surprisingly long period of time.\n\nAs an interesting fact about it. In the days/weeks after 9/11 when there were no flights in all of North America, the weather data from that time period represents the single clearest period of time to show climatologists what the effects of the mid/high-altitude pollution from jet engines is on localized climate/weather. Nobody is willing to just shut down air travel, or throw hundreds/thousands of planes through a normally unoccupied piece of airspace for such an experiment of course, so this is the only such data of its kind."}
