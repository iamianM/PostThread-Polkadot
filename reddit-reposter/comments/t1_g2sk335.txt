My primary school teacher did this while he was our home teacher and we would always get some cake and pizza. But then he was going through a divorce and honestly that man looked so broken near the end of the year but the whole staff gave him a party for the end of the year and I never saw him so happy. I dont know what happened to him afterwards but I know he's still teaching in primary school.

Edit: wow this is insane, and I will try to contact them because honestly they deserve this love

Edit 2: Finally contacted them and we had a chat, he is happily retired and remarried and is happy that you guys sent so much kindness his way
