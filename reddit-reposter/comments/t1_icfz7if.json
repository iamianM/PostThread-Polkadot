I had an ex that used to demand I tell him what I talked about in my sessions and it was super uncomfortable. With my current partner we are both in therapy and if it's a phone session the other goes in a different room. If we want to talk about something we told the psych or something we will tell our psych at the next appointment we do, but I would never ask and nor would he. We might ask \"how did it go?\" To which the other may say \"it was good\" or \"it was emotionally draining\", but that's as far as it should go. \n(These are personal sessions, not couples therapy, we're not in that)"}
