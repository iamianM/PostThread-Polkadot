They already struggle as it is to identify copyrighted content in just the monetized content. They know EXACTLY what it is they're looking for yet they still can't accurately catch it on a large scale. Facebook and Twitter run into similar issues, google just happens to handle it the best right now.\n \nYet we have people who somehow want them to do literally anything about deepfakes and fake accounts, something that is only getting harder and harder to define when you know it's there, and will be virtually impossible to define on that large of a scale. \n\nI'm VERY anti big tech. I think these companies should have been broken up years ago and they wield far too much power. But even given the limitless budgets and advanced tech they have, what's being asked of them is nearly impossible. The fact that YouTube is able to moderate anything at all with any sort of consistency is a miracle of engineering, and asking them to somehow move from that to identifying deepfakes or fake accounts on that large of a scale is ridiculous.\n\nI think fake accounts and deepfakes are obviously going to be very problematic going forward, I just think giving fines to companies until they come up with the mythical magic bullet solution is the wrong approach to dealing with it."}
