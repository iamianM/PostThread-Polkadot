Clogged nose pores, a laugh that sounds like a muppet, big toe nails that just look a little bit weird, or that single long hair growing from inside their ear that just keeps coming back no matter what they do. If it\u2019s going to make them feel insecure or unloved, this is something you should just keep to yourself. \n\nIn a relationship, you learn each other\u2019s weak points and vulnerabilities, and using them against your partner is a boundary that, once you cross it, you can\u2019t come back from. Once you make someone feel like they can\u2019t trust you with their vulnerable self, your relationship is on its way out."}
