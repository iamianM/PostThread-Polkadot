Reminds me of [this old post from swearingpattern (Instagram)](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9zwpfWhtmH/): \n\n>\"A friend was stressing out so this is what I told her. Sometimes I forget it so I'm posting it here too:\r  \n\r  \nIn all my brushes with death I couldn't figure out why I should bother. What I came to believe is that we are here to experience life and love it. We are tools of nature endowed with self-awareness and individuality so that life can have a new experience of itself. Whenever I can't handle things, I remember that my sole purpose is to experience life for as long as I am this individual. That's all, everything else is just window dressing.\""}
