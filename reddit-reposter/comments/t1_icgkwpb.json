I always have fun going to the Oscars. I always look forward to getting a gift basket for being a presenter. [Laughs] I give stuff to my relatives; my daughter and my wife would take stuff out.

My yardstick of success is my happiness: Am I satisfied with what I\u2019m doing? I\u2019m not doing statue-chasing movies. You know [whispers]: \u2018If you do this movie, you\u2019ll win an Oscar.\u2019 No, thanks. I\u2019d rather be Nick Fury. Or having fun being Mace Windu with a lightsaber in my hand.\u201d"}
