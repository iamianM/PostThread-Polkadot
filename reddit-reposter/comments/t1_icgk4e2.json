While it's important that both people get something out of it - treating things like transactions creates misunderstandings, false entitlements, and causes at least one person in the relationship to feel like they're owed something or owe others.\n\nTransactional approaches are often quite toxic for a healthy relationship is the short of it - and I want to highlight that because, jokes aside, it's a pretty serious thing and we're often given bad impressions about how a relationship should be. I'm sure you've seen to sentiment before where someone pays for something of someone else and then expects some kind of favor in return, often sexual. It's important to avoid that behavior in yourself as it can lead to pretty hostile behavior towards someone you otherwise care about.\n\nBut yeah, at the same time, you should also be getting something out of it. A lot of it is going to come down to feeling out the broad strokes and figuring out what you want and communicating that. Open communication is seriously undervalued."}
