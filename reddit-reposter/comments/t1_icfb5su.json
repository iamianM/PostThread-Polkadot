He retired about ten years ago and since he\u2019s an active guy was looking for something part time in his new city to keep him occupied. He would complain to my brother and I that \u201ceveryone wants to pay me $10 an hour without benefits\u201d for work he was making $80k+ doing before. Mind you, at the same time he was worrying/criticizing my brother for not finding good work and trying to stay afloat on several part time retail jobs. Still don\u2019t know if he entirely got it but we kept telling him\u2026that\u2019s what work is like now, every company wants to get away with murder."}
